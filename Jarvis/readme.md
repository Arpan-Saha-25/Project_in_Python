# Jarvis: Your Personal Virtual Assistant

Welcome to the Jarvis project! This Python-based virtual assistant can recognize speech, process commands, and perform a variety of tasks including web browsing, playing music, and fetching the latest news.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Listen for commands through your microphone.
- **Web Browsing**: Open websites like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
- **Music Playback**: Play songs from your music library.
- **News Updates**: Fetch and read out the latest news headlines.
- **AI Assistance**: Use OpenAI's capabilities to respond to queries.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 requests openai pocketsphinx
```

Additionally, you will need an API key for the OpenAI service and a news API. Make sure to replace the placeholders in the code with your actual keys.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arpan-Saha-25/Project_in_Python.git
   cd ./Jarvis
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Update API Keys**:
   - In the code, replace `newsapiKey` and `api_key` with your own keys.

4. **Run the Assistant**:
   ```bash
   python jarvis.py
   ```

## Usage

- Activate Jarvis by saying the wake word "Jarvis."
- After activation, you can issue commands like:
  - "Open Google"
  - "Play [song name]"
  - "News"
  - Ask any question for AI assistance.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with speech recognition, ensure your microphone is set up correctly.
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection for API calls.
